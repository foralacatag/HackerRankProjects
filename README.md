# HackerRankProjects

This repository contains my submissions to [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/OrsunFatma?hr_r=1).

I started solving problems on Hacker Rank as a way to get into practice Programming so most solutions you will find here are written in Java and Python

* Chapters are ordered in folders
* I usually browse the leaderboard after having solved a new challenge. 
Classes that end in _Best_ are used to store a solution I found particularly elegant.


Happy reading!
